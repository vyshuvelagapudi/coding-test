Problem Statement: Assume you are asked to get your code running in the cloud using AWS. What tools and AWS services would you use to deploy the API, database, and a scheduled version of your data ingestion code? Write up a description of your approach.

To deploy the API, database, and scheduled version of the data ingestion code in AWS, I would use the following tools and services:
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda: Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications. It supports a variety of programming languages and platforms. AWS Lambda is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) that allows running code without the need to manage servers. It supports multiple languages and can be triggered by events or scheduled using AWS CloudWatch Events.
2. Amazon RDS: Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines, including PostgreSQL and MySQL, which are suitable for the data models designed in the exercise.
3. AWS CloudFormation: AWS CloudFormation provides a way to manage AWS resources as code. I can define a CloudFormation template that includes the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function, the RDS database, and other required resources, such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles.
4. AWS CodePipeline: AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that automates the building, testing, and deployment of applications. I can use it to create a pipeline that automatically deploys the code changes to the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function whenever I push changes to the code repository.
5. AWS CloudWatch: AWS CloudWatch provides monitoring and logging for AWS resources and applications. I can use CloudWatch to monitor the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function and the RDS database, and set up alarms to notify me when there are any issues.
6. AWS S3: AWS S3 provides a secure, scalable, and highly available object storage service. I can use it to store the weather data files and access them from the data ingestion code running in Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function.
7. AWS EventBridge: AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to integrate applications using events. I can use it to schedule the data ingestion code to run periodically using AWS CloudWatch Events.

My approach to deploying the API, database, and scheduled version of the data ingestion code would be as follows:
1. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function for the REST API and deploy the API code.
2. Create an Amazon RDS database instance for the weather data records and configure the connection settings for the API to use.
3. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that includes the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function, the RDS database, and other required resources, such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles.
4. Use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline that automatically deploys the code changes to the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function whenever there are changes to the code repository.
5. Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch for the Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function and the RDS database, and configure alarms to notify me when there are any issues.
6. Use AWS S3 to store the weather data files and access them from the data ingestion code running in Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function.
7. Use AWS EventBridge to schedule the data ingestion code to run periodically using AWS CloudWatch Events.
By following this approach, I can easily deploy and manage the API, database, and data ingestion code in AWS, and ensure they are secure, scalable, and highly available.
